Gnote
-----

Gnote is a C++ port of Tomboy

I wrote this as an experiment, and the emphasis has been put on making
it a clone as close as possible to the original.

Installing
----------

See the INSTALL file.

Importing Tomboy notes
----------------------

As of now, you have to manually copy the data.
Simply copy ~/.tomboy to ~/.gnote
It is deliberate that it does not share the storage with Tomboy.
Note: due to the way Tomboy work, the "pinned" state of the notes 
will not be carried over.

Getting the code
----------------

The source tree is currently hosted on Gitorious.
http://gitorious.org/projects/gnote
